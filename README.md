# Another_Steganography_Tool_SteggyPie
This is a tool I made for Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography in PNG images. You can hide or retrieve messages in specific color channels

You can use the .py script directly, or for convenience, download the executable (.exe) available in the Releases section. The executable was created using PyInstaller for ease of use.

Simply select your preferred color channel and choose to either encrypt or decrypt messages.
