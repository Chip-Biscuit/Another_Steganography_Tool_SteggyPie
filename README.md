# Another_Steganography_Tool_SteggyPie
This is a tool I made for Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography in PNG images. You can hide or retrieve messages in specific color channels

You can use the .py script or in Releases there is an exe for ease of use you can run also made using pyinstaller. 

pick your color channel and either encrypt or decript messaeges.
