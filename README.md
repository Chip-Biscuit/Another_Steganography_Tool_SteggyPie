# Another_Steganography_Tool_SteggyPie
This is a tool created for Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography in PNG images. It allows you to hide or retrieve messages in specific color channels. I developed it while exploring Capture the Flag challenges and discovering a fascination with steganography.

You can use the .py script directly, or for convenience, download the executable (.exe) available in the Releases section. The executable was created using PyInstaller for ease of use.

Simply select your preferred color channel and choose to either encrypt or decrypt messages.
